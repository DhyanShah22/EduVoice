<p id="description">Education is a fundamental right, yet millions of students in rural areas worldwide lack access to quality educational resources. This project, developed for VOPA (Voluntary Organization for Public Awareness), a nonprofit dedicated to improving education in villages, aims to bridge this gap using cutting-edge technology. By integrating machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs), and modern web development frameworks, we’ve built a platform that enhances the learning experience for both students and teachers.</p>

<h1> The Vision </h1>

<p>Our platform’s core objective is to create a comprehensive learning environment that adapts to the needs of students. By leveraging AI, we can assess a student's reading ability, generate customized tests, and provide actionable insights to educators. The ultimate goal is to enable rural students to achieve their full potential through personalized learning experiences.</p>

<h1> Project Overview </h1>
<p> The platform consists of several key components:

  React Frontend & Node.js Backend: A responsive user interface built with React that communicates seamlessly with a Node.js backend ensures a smooth and interactive user experience.

  ML-Powered Speech-to-Text Conversion: A custom-built ML model deployed on a Flask server converts students' speech to text with high accuracy, forming the foundation for subsequent assessments.

  LLM-Based Accuracy Checker: An LLM evaluates the accuracy of the converted text, assigning reading levels (word, sentence, paragraph, story) based on performance.

   LangChain for Question Generation: Teachers can generate test questions effortlessly using LangChain, which creates a comprehensive, scoreable test in seconds.

   LLM-Enhanced Document Interaction: A sophisticated LLM-driven chat interface built using LangChain and Streamlit enables users to interact with documents, providing context-aware answers to queries.
